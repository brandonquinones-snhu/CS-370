# CS-370

In this course I learned about neural networks and machine learning. Right now, the emerging trend in CS is machine learning and artificial intelligence and we studying the early versions of it and how the different kinds of algorithms help nueral networks be trained. We also created a self-learning program for a game in which the agent learns how to beat a pirate treasure hunt game on it's own throught self-play. 

In a the bigger picture, the demand for computer scientists will increase as there is a growing demand for artificial intelligence use cases as well. Computer scientists are the backbone of the advancements of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Because the algorithms used for these nueral networks are heavy and require lots of computing power which ends up being expensive. Finding more efficient ways to create an intelligent agent is the pursuit of many right now. Some benefits of more efficient nueral netowrks are reduced learning times, better accuracy, reduced computing power, and the ability to offer services at a cheaper and more competitive price point.

There are also ethical responsibilities that come with being a computer sceintist. Eliminating biases and unfairness in artificial intellience is important as in some applications it can affect people negatively. Computer scientists must also be careful to eliminate the use of any algorithms used for harm, as people can use artificial intelligence to deceive or impersonate others.
